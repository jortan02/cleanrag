# CleanRAG

**CleanRAG** is an interactive tool built with Streamlit, designed to help developers and researchers optimize their Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The application provides a clean UI for uploading documents, configuring chunking and indexing strategies, and evaluating performanceâ€”all within a streamlined environment.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Intuitive interface for document upload and configuration  
- Support for multiple text splitting and indexing strategies  
- Integration with OpenAI language and embedding models  
- Evaluation of RAG performance using the RAGAS framework  
- Side-by-side configuration comparison for iterative optimization  

## ðŸ§  Technical Highlights

- Built with **Streamlit** for rapid interface development  
- Indexing powered by **LlamaIndex** for flexible, ETL-style text chunking and retrieval  
- Model interaction and embeddings via **OpenAI APIs**  
- Evaluation using **RAGAS metrics**, including:
  - Faithfulness  
  - Context utilization  
  - Answer relevance
